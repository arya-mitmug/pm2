    <h2>The Origin of Pave the Planet Green</h2>
    <p>The PVPG Organization started as an Alumni Advocacy Project of the Philippine Science High School Southern Mindanao Campus, bringing together young professionals and student leaders who shared a passion for city development and community service. From small initiatives such as local consultations and urban clean-up drives, the group steadily grew in scope and reputation. By its 3rd Foundation Anniversary, the members formally established PVPG as an independent region-wide organization, marking the beginning of its stronger role in shaping sustainable development efforts in Davao and beyond. <br> <br> On its current path, PVPG has earned recognition as a UN-accredited organization with a growing network of over 50 full-time workers, 30 part-time members, and hundreds of volunteer advocates. Backed by more than 10 sponsorships and partnerships, it has built a remarkable record in promoting eco-friendly housing, disaster-resilient planning, and green urban spaces. With its diverse membership and commitment to service, PVPG continues to stand as a strong force for inclusive growth and future-ready communities in Mindanao.</p>

    <p>I am Arya Nurjannah B. Mitmug and Iâ€™m an advocate for Sustainable Urban Planning for the community and the environment. My advocacy has been rooted in the belief that communities can thrive when people work together to build safer, greener, and more inclusive spaces. What began as simple volunteer work with fellow PSHS SMC students grew into a wider effort to promote sustainable living, community participation, and care for the environment.</p>
