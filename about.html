        <h2>The Origin of Pave the Planet Green</h2>
        <p>The PVPG Organization started as an Alumni Advocacy Project of the Philippine Science High School Southern Mindanao Campus, bringing together young professionals and student leaders who shared a passion for city development and community service. From small initiatives such as local consultations and urban clean-up drives, the group steadily grew in scope and reputation. By its 3rd Foundation Anniversary, the members formally established PVPG as an independent region-wide organization, marking the beginning of its stronger role in shaping sustainable development efforts in Davao and beyond. <br> <br> On its current path, PVPG has earned recognition as a UN-accredited organization with a growing network of over 50 full-time workers, 30 part-time members, and hundreds of volunteer advocates. Backed by more than 10 sponsorships and partnerships, it has built a remarkable record in promoting eco-friendly housing, disaster-resilient planning, and green urban spaces. With its diverse membership and commitment to service, PVPG continues to stand as a strong force for inclusive growth and future-ready communities in Mindanao.</p>
